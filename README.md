This is a demo game using Unity 2D that was used as the template for the Lunch and Learn talk I gave on 8/21/14.

The repo includes the Powerpoint and the Unity project.

To run the Project, simply;

1. Load in Unity
2. Open the Complete Scene
3. Press play

The controls will work with either Keyboard or by Touching the left and right side of the gamescreen.
